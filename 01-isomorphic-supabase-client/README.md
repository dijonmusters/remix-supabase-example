# Creating an isomorphic Supabase client in Remix application

This is the example repo for [this blog](https://jonmeyers.io/blog/create-an-isomorphic-supabase-client-in-remix-with-environment-variables).

If you want to go deeper with Remix and Supabase, I recommend you check out [my new Level Up Tutorials course](https://leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/realtime-remix-with-supabase) where we build a realtime chat application from scratch!
