# Creating a realtime app with Remix and Supabase

This is the example repo for [this blog series](https://jonmeyers.io/blog-series/creating-a-realtime-app-with-remix-and-supabase), where we are building a realtime, authenticated, fullstack application using [Remix](https://remix.run/) and [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).

If you want to go deeper with Remix, Supabase, auth and realtime, I recommend you check out [my new Level Up Tutorials course](https://leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/realtime-remix-with-supabase) where we build a realtime chat application from scratch!
